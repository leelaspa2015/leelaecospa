        <p class="text-justify">Sports Massage is geared towards athletes of every kind, whether you are a professional athlete or weekend jogger. Sports massage can be used to prevent injuries, promote flexibility, improve performance and endurance. The therapist focuses on areas of the body that are overused or stressed from repetitive and often aggressive movements. Talk to one of our RMTs (registered massage therapist) to find a plan that works best for your lifestyle, level of activity and budget. The therapist may also incorporate stretching and fascial techniques, as well send you home with a homecare regime to increase results.</p>
