                            <p class="text-justify">This 75 minute class has been inspired from the Ashtanga primary series of poses; the class focus is on linking together postures with breath -creating flowing dynamic movement. The class includes the use of a focused gaze (drsti), the breath (pranayama) and the energy “locks” (bandhas) resulting in a powerful discipline for cultivating physical, mental and spiritual health. Core strengthening postures are included in every sequence. All levels of practitioners are welcome as modifications will be offered. Come join us for an exploration of self!</p>
