                    <p>Sandra is a graduate from the Canadian Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine located in Calgary, AB.</p>
                    <p>Chinese medicine has a holistic view of your health. Sandra’s objective is to bring balance to the body, mind and spirit and believes all aspects of an individual must be considered in order to achieve this.</p>
                    <p>Sandra works as a general practitioner, treating a broad range of conditions including; insomnia, migraine, menopause, menstrual difficulties, infertility, sciatica, frozen shoulder, depression and anxiety.</p>
                    <p>But Traditional Chinese Medicine isn’t just for people who are unwell. It is equally if not more effective for people who are well that want to stay well, do more or perform better. Being proactive about your health now, can help ease the aging process.</p>
                    <p>She reminds her patients that their own body has the incredible ability to regain and maintain good health. Live healthier, be happier, do more…naturally!</p>
