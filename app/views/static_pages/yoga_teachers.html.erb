                    <h3>MAYA</h3>
                    <p>Maya Sanya Posavec has been rock’n the Leela Eco Spa and Studio since 2005. She is a Trinity trained and Yoga Alliance Certified Instructor. Her unique teaching style has been cultivating since 2005 and Maya has enjoyed being an active member of the Leela community just as long! Maya’s specialty is modifying the practice for injury and she is well versed at applying the appropriate therapeutic principles of yoga to gently heal the body.</p>
                    <p>“With just the right cue, I can watch a student’s posture spring to life! It’s my passion to find the precise words and just the right way to navigate a yogi to their (ah ha!) awakening moments. I feel totally engaged when I teach, (equally) as I do when I’m in my own personal practice.”</p>
                    <p>Maya is an avid eco-activist. When she is not in the studio, Maya relishes in the positive karma created by the simplicity of raising her daughter (Ruby – picture above) with gentle tones, recycling, shopping eco-smart and gardening. On her more adventuresome side (not that parenting is not) she frequently travels and channels her energy to various eco-sustainable fronts for ocean conservation.</p>
                    <p>Her daughter Ruby, is as much a part of Leela as Maya. When Maya is busy with classes, Ruby can be seen at Leela tidying up, folding laundry or filling water. Her quiet presence is a reminder about how we all can contribute to our community in little but powerful ways.</p>
                    <p>“Yoga has taught me how to listen, to most honestly see where I’am, observe how I affect others and my environment, and then cultivate the discipline to evoke change”.</p>

                    <h3>SAMANTHA</h3>
                    <p>Samantha Baldwin has been delving into Yoga philosophy since she was 17. Alongside her English degree, she took as many Eastern Religion courses as the University would allow including a level 1 Sanskrit course. Her deep fascination with Hinduism and its mythology drew her to 200+ hr. Yoga Teacher Training in 2012 where she graduated from Yoga Passage in 2013. </p>
                    <p>She also has a deep passion for working with moms, babies and all things relating to birth. She received her birth and post-partum doula training in 2003 and was certified as a prenatal and post-natal yoga teacher in 2014. She has also deepened her overall personal yoga practice as well as her teaching practice in 2014 by becoming a certified Yoga Nidra teacher. </p>
                    <p>Her classes often include Crystal Tones’ Crystal Healing Bowls as well as Young Living oils. She is an explorer of the unseen and her curiosity and exploration makes each class an inner adventure.</p>

                    <h3>SARAH</h3>
                    <p>I am a political scientist; art historian; PR professional with the Bad Girls Club YYC; world traveler; Etch-A-Sketch Artist; a unique individual with an authentic personality (yes, that’s right, an Etch-A-Sketch Artist). I am fairly new to teaching physical asana but certainly not a stranger to yoga. Yoga is life. I had my world literally flipped upside down in 2012 after going on a yoga retreat to Costa Rica with teacher Alice Hong (The trip ended with a bungee jumping off a bridge into a river. Since then, I can say inversions are easy). Costa Rica is a turning point in both my personal and spiritual practice. Shortly after returning from Costa Rica I was approached by my long time mentors and teachers, Lisa Whitford and Curran Watts, to take a teacher training with Define Yoga in Brazil, 2013. I have had an undeniable calling towards becoming a yoga teacher – it is just about time I answered the call. I like to combine colorful analogies with physical movement in a practice that is both yin and yang; fun and accessible to everyone.</p>

                    <h3>BRANDY</h3>
                   <p>Brandy has been practicing yoga for more than a decade, exploring a variety of yoga styles, including Iyengar, Hatha, and Ashtanga. By focusing on alignment within the postures and using props to modify the practice, Brandy leads a gentle yoga class that is accessible for everyone and every body – regardless of level of experience, previous injuries or current abilities.</p>
                   <p>Brandy completed her Yoga Teacher Training at Yoga Passage in 2009. She completed her first Pre- and Postnatal Yoga Teacher course while eight months pregnant with her daughter, in August 2011, and her second in March and April 2012.</p>
                   <p>As a new mom herself, Brandy knows just how important a regular yoga practice can be to support your journey through motherhood – from pre-conception throughout baby’s first years. Yoga provides some time to reconnect with your body, relax the mind and quiet anxious or stressful thoughts, and to nurture both yourself and your baby-to-be.</p>

                    <h3>JO-ANNE</h3>
                    <p>My very first yoga class was at Leela. I started practicing yoga when a friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer and I was looking for a way to cope. At first I didn’t know what to expect. Being plus size there were no classes designed for people like me, but it only took a few classes, the most amazing teachers and I was hooked.</p>
                    <p>A couple of years after starting my practice I took my yoga teacher training in Nelson and graduated in May of 2012. It’s been an incredible journey.  Yoga has taught me a lot.  Two things I believe in my heart is there is no problem that can’t be solved if you are will to go to your mat and be still,  or there is option B spend a minimum of 10 minutes hanging out in a hammock.</p>
                    <p>I believe everyone can do yoga…it’s not about touching your toes it’s about what you learn on the way down.  Creating PS(Plus Size)I love yoga continues to be a labour of love for me.</p>
                    <p>Don’t worry if you fall – your mat will catch you. I’ll see you there!</p>

                    <p>Well, to start, Bridgeland is my hood! This neighbourhood is near and dear to my heart so it means the world to me that I get to work where I live.</p>
                    <p>If we haven’t met yet, my name is Jessica and I teach yoga here. This studio was actually the first place I ever practiced and then became the first place I ever taught. Back then, I was working the desk to supplement my teaching, but now (5 years later) I have expanded as a teacher to teach at four studios, a couple of gyms and corporate locations galore.</p>
                    <p>I have also been lucky enough to train and teach in New Zealand, Fiji and Indonesia! Teaching is my full-time get-up but I am certainly busy doing my Geology degree, traveling, hiking and hanging out with my cat, Kevin. See you on the mat!</p>

                    <h3>MINA</h3>
                    <p>I first saw yoga being practiced when I was on a backpacking trip in India in 2001. I was so intrigued by this moving meditative practice that when I returned I enrolled in an ashtanga class. At first it was a way to compliment my active lifestyle as an avid runner, hiker and mountain biker. It didn't take long for me to realize that yoga had so much more to offer than just stretching. Practicing and studying this ancient tradition has made me realize that every day is an opportunity to watch the inner journey unfold. I believe that yoga is a philosophy that goes far beyond the physical practice. For me, yoga has truly become a moving meditation, where the mind, body and spirit become one in order to freely explore and heal. In that meditative process, one is able to quiet the mind and enjoy the silence that comes with focusing on the breath.</p>

                    <p>I've always been drawn to share my passions with others and my friends call me a natural born teacher. I've taught everything from preschool dance classes, ESL for children and adults to Spanish at the U of C. I've always been a bit of a professional student, constantly wanting to learn more and take in all of the knowledge that I can. After completing my Masters degree in Spanish and enrolling in the Master of Teaching program at the U of C, I decided I also wanted to share my passion of yoga with others. I completed the teacher training program at Yoga Passage with Tracy Mann and Lerrita Rubinoff in March of 2005 and have been teaching ever since. I returned to India in 2009 to stay at the Anand Prakash Yoga Ashram in Rishikesh to further my own practice.</p>

                    <p>I am blessed to have a strong yoga community, a supportive husband, and two wonderfully curious and energetic children who teach me more about yoga and the inner journey everyday. As a resident in the neighborhood, I am inspired to offer yoga and meditation classes at Leela.  My teaching focuses on proper alignment and breath and body awareness. My goal as a teacher is to guide students to be present by calming the mind, building strength and breathing.</p>

                    <p>"Nothing in the world can purify as powerfully as wisdom; practiced in yoga, you find this wisdom within yourself" <b>~Bhagavad Gita</b></p>
