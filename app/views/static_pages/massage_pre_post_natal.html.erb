        <p class="text-justify">Prenatal massage is a safe and effective way to reduce the discomforts of pregnancy!  Headaches, muscle stiffness, backaches, fatigue and swelling are all common ailments that can occur during pregnancy, and taking some time to yourself on the table can help alleviate all of them! Massage encourages blood circulation, which helps relax the nervous system, allowing for a better sleep, and attention to specific muscles will help ease the pain of any postural changes which occur!  Once laying on your tummy isn't possible, your therapist will have you lay on your side, supported by one of our amazingly comfortable full body pregnancy pillows so all areas of your body get the proper attention they deserve! Unwind and relax while we help keep you and your baby healthy!</p>
