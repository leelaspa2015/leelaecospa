                            <p>Acupuncture is the stimulation of specific acupuncture points along the skin of the body using thin needles. Stimulating specific acupuncture points corrects imbalances in the flow of qi – “life energy” – through channels known as meridians.</p>
                            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine encompasses a group of “modalities” or treatments, including acupuncture, herbal medicines, and cupping. Chinese medicine has a holistic view of your health. It sees your body as a small universe while the environment as the large universe.  Balance and harmony need to be achieved not only within your body, but also with the outside world for you to achieve optimal health. The final goal is to bring balance to the body, mind and spirit and all aspects of an individual must be considered in order to achieve this. </p>
